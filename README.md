# Taro
Taro is an open-source heterogeneous task graph programming system using C++ Coroutine. Taro provides an expressive task graph programming model that relieves users from handling complex coroutine management. It also introduces a coroutine-aware work-stealing algorithm to support the programming model while minimizing CPU migration overhead.
